# 🗂️ Employee Data Management App - Node.js CLI Based

A feature-rich CLI (Command Line Interface) application for managing employee data using **JavaScript (Node.js)**. This app is a **rewrite and improvement** of my previous project written in **C++**, with added enhancements like bulk input, interactive editing, real file persistence, and modular design.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project simulates a basic employee database management system that runs entirely in the terminal. It's designed for learning purposes, suitable for beginner-to-intermediate developers who want to understand:

- How to structure CLI apps in Node.js
- How to manage JSON-file-based data without a database
- How to modularize code and separate logic
- How to mimic real-world HR-like data operations

## 🧬 Origin & Reference

This Node.js project is a **refactored and modernized version** of my previous C++ project:

### 🔁 Rewritten From:
- [Project-Algoritma-Pemrograman](https://github.com/Nekonepan/College/tree/main/C%2B%2B/Project-Algoritma-Pemrograman)

### 🎯 Enhancements Compared to C++ Version:

## ⚙️ How the App Works

Here’s a simplified breakdown of the logic flow behind the app:

1. 📂 **Program loads existing employee data** from `data-karyawan.json` at startup.
2. 📜 A **main menu** is displayed using `inquirer`, with options like View, Add, Search, Edit, Sort, Statistics, Backup/Restore, and Exit.
3. 📥 When adding data:
   - User is asked how many records to add (input `0` = cancel)
   - Each input is validated (non-empty, unique ID)
   - Data is optionally saved after confirmation
4. 🔍 When searching:
   - User can search by ID or Name (case-insensitive, partial match supported)
   - If multiple results are found (e.g., duplicate names), a list is displayed to select the correct record
5. ✏️ When editing:
   - User selects data from search results (by ID or Name)
   - Empty inputs are ignored (retain original value)
   - A summary table is shown after edit
   - Confirmation is required before saving
6. 🔃 When sorting:
   - User can choose Ascending or Descending by ID
   - Sorted result can be saved or discarded
7. 📊 Statistics:
   - Show total employee count
   - Group employees by job position
   - Count employees by ID prefix
8. 📁 Data is stored persistently in **JSON format** for easier read/write operations, backups, and logs.

The application runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

## 📝 Data Format

### Data is stored in the `data-karyawan.json` file with the format:

```
[
  {
    "ID": "A123",
    "NAMA": "Nekonepan",
    "JABATAN": "Manager",
    "TELP": "081234567890"
  },
  {
    "ID": "B321",
    "NAMA": "Lutfan Alaudin",
    "JABATAN": "HRD",
    "TELP": "080987654321"
  }
]
```

- Data is structured as an array of objects
- Each object represents one employee record
- This format makes it easier to read, write, backup, and restore data

### Deleted data is stored in `logs/data-terhapus.json` with the format:

```
[
  {
    "ID": "H739",
    "NAMA": "Farhan Wulandari",
    "JABATAN": "Supervisor",
    "TELP": "08323250265",
    "deletedAt": "2025-08-18T10:30:45.123Z"
  }
]
```

- Each deleted record is logged with the same structure as the main data
- An additional field `"deletedAt"` records the exact time the deletion occurred
